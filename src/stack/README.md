## What is a stack? 
The stack abstract data structure is used to store information in a manner where the first item stored in the stack will be the last item retrieved from the stack. It works works just like a stack of trays in a cafeteria. a tray stack only allows you to put a tray on top of the stack or remove a tray from the top of the stack, where trays in the middle of the stack are unaccecable.   

A stack allways has two actions `push` and `pop` for adding and removing items "from the top of the stack". 

## The push action

The pop action removes and returns a value from the top of the stack.
