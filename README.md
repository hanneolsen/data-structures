# Data Structures in Javascript
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/slugbyte/data-structures.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/slugbyte/data-structures)

## Goals
* The implamentations will be test driven
* The implamentaions will use closures to maintain state (no classes or constructurs)
* Each data structure will have docs to describe their use cases, link resources, and list exercises 
* Generates a module

## What are "abstract data types"?
Often when the words "data type" are used together they often refering to model of some "type" of information. The phrase "data type" may remind you of _primitive_ data types in programming languages like floating point numbers, integers, booleans, and characters, or perhaps it reminds you of more complex data types such as JPEG image files, WAV audio files, and MP4 movie files. If you are familiar with Object Oriented Programing (OOP), you should be used to modeling the all types of information in to classes which could be though of as "types", for example you may have at some point modeled user data, website content, or video game state.   

Where ever there is data in software there is usually actions that can be preformed on that data. These actions are typicaly functions desgined to limit the ways in which the data can be mutated (modified). One of OOP's main goals was to couple data types with the their actions (class methods).  
 
Over time many software design patterns have emmerged as programmers have realized certian data types, data actions, and software architecutes have repeatedly solved specific common problems. One category of design patterns that has emmerged are called Abstract Data Types (ADTs). ADTs are models for data types that are defined by their behavior instead of there inforamtion. At first this can seem a bit confusing, but Its only giving a name (ADT) to a thing that programmers naturally do; coupling actions with data. Often this is thought of in reverse like data is thought to have a type, and actions can belong to that type. However ADTs define common behaviors or actions as a type and agnostic to the kind of information stored.

Abstract data types are amazing tools that solve many common programming problems. Learing to implament them can greatly inhance your understanding of software design problems.
